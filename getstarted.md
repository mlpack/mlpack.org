# Overview

There are multiple ways to get mlpack up and running. Python bindings can be
installed using pip or conda, or built from source (see "Build from source"
tutorials).  Julia bindings can be installed via Julia's `Pkg` package manager.

For C++, if mlpack is not available via your preferred OS package manager, or if
you need to build your own version (e.g. to apply optimizations, use a different
set of BLAS/LAPACK, or build a different configuration), please refer to the
"Build from source" tutorials.  For Windows, prebuilt binaries will help you get
started without the need of building mlpack. These packages include both the C++
mlpack library as well as the CLI tools.

Once you get mlpack running, check out the [documentation](docs.html) or the
[examples repository](https://github.com/mlpack/examples/), which contains
simple example usages of mlpack.

Here is a summary of the currently available distribution options you can use
